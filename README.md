- 👋 Hi, I’m @BrettBeacon
- 👀 I’m interested in gaming, coding, computers and gardening(food growing)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a Bachelor of Game Design @ USC
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any sort of code work, looking to learn more and more with others.
- 📫 How to reach me: through twitter or git.
- My indie game studio itch.io is https://lonelylighthouse.itch.io/, this is the beginnings of my portfolio for games I make or code I write, I call it my indie game studio because ideally I would like to make some games and eventually release them on Steam or Google Play store.
